                <p>Most gym goers and trainers have experienced kettlebells. These peculiar looking weights are not the novelty they were ten years ago and now have a place in many training facilities. However, most people only have seen and been taught to use these cannonballs with handles as a fitness tool. Many athletes remain oblivious that they have been used for over sixty years as integral tool of a fully-fledged sport.</p>
                <p>The first official girevoy sport (the original Russian name of the sport) competition was held in 1948 in the old USSR and it developed from there across the 1950s and ‘60s. This advancement came mainly from the military, who had seen how this form of training benefited the troops. In the ‘70s, girevoy sport entered the National Sports Federation as the official ethnic sport of Russia</p>
                <p>Kettlebell Sport is “endurance weightlifting". The two main disciplines of the sport are the biathlon (which is comprised of two separate events, the jerk and the snatch) and the long-cycle which is clean and jerk.</p>
                <h3>Kettlebell Jerk lift</h3>
                <p>The jerk requires you to clean the kettlebells to your chest once, and then jerk them as many times overhead as possible in 10 mins.</p>
                <div class="text-center">

                <h3>Kettlebell Snatch lift</h3>
                <p>The snatch is performed by swinging the kettlebell between your legs and brought up to the overhead position in one uninterrupted motion. Only one hand switch is permitted in 10 mins.</p>

                <p>Training methodologies vary greatly from athlete to athlete and from coach to coach; however, the one principle that does not change is the requirement for supreme efficiency. Without efficient technique it is not possible to achieve the high numbers of repetitions required to be successful in the sport. All the lifts are performed aiming to use only the exact amount of energy needed and using momentum to the lifter’s advantage during the concentric phase. To achieve such efficient technique, the jerk, snatch, and long cycle need to be patiently and consistently drilled.</p>

                <p>Members wishing to lift in competitions can also avail of programmes to do at home designed to increase stamina.</p>

                <p>Competition kettlebell are made of steel and are all the same size regardless of weight for a uniform training experience at all times. These competition kettlebells have 35mm handles. The bells are designed for high repetition exercises. If you have used barbells, think about when you train with plates that are all the same size regardless of weight so your form is always the same during Olympic lifts. Competition Kettlebells are the same premise in kettlebell form.</p>

                <h3>Competition vs. Cast Iron kettlebell</h3>
                <p>Competition kettlebells are designed to used by with just one hand. Their handle is much smaller and is squarer in design. The advantage of these types of kettlebells is that your hand doesn’t slide around due to the limited space plus you can get used to the size even when the weight changes.</p>
                <p>The cast iron kettlebell is produced from one solid piece of metal, so their size increases with the weight. You will notice that the handle is wider enabling you to use two hands if necessary so all those double handed exercises are now possible.</p>

              <p>Competition kettlebells have distinctive color to indicate their weight. Traditionally the lightest is 8kg and each following is 4 kg heavier. All weights that we traditionally think of as 'in-between' weights like 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34 are the same color as the weight 2 kilograms below them but are notated by black bands on the handle in competitive lifting.</p>
