|G19|officer|increase our authority on the subject in the eyes of the visitors|

### 1.2 Scope plane
It has been decided to create a static website. In light of that decision we do not go forward with
- G5: this goal would be for presence on a social network site, not for a homepage,
- G10: the calendar functionality would require database and programming, therefore out of scope for now,
- G17: at the moment could not obtain these training plans

The following table lists the planned features, each feature referenced with original goal(s):

|F#|Goal|Feature|
|--|----|-------|
|F1|G3|build a custom static website with responsive pages for mobile, tablet and desktop|
|F2||have navigation bar on each pages|
|F3|G1, G19|display LKC’s logo and name, display club’s affiliation with AIKLF and IUKL with logo, name and link, provide description about each|
|F4|G16|provide description about how to prepare, what to bring, what to expect on the first training|
|F5|G7, G12|display attractive photos and texts, member testimonials|
|F6|G13, G19|describe what we do|
|F7|G13|describe why we train|
|F8|G13, G19|describe how: training methods|
|F9|G13, G19|describe who we are, how to contact us|
|F10|G13|inform about training times|
|F11|G13|describe where we train including venue facilities|
|F12|G8|present news articles|
|F13|G8, G9, G18|sign up to newsletter (email)|
|F14|G6, G16|ask Medical Form to be filled|
|F15|G3|allow first time applicant to announce self for training, so coach is notified, can learn more beforehand, this way improving first time experience|
|F16|G3, G6, G14|explain membership|
|F20|G10|display an event/training calendar, allow members to sign up/off|

## 3. Technologies and Tools Used

- The project's product (the website) was written in HTML and CSS, utilising [Bootstrap 5.0 Beta](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) framework (which itself uses CSS and JavaScript). Bootstrap is used for its responsive utilities. There is a petite JavaScript in `index.html` to solve a specific issue.
- The images were manipulated with program [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/). Mainly used for cropping, resizing, background removal and format conversion.
- Created wireframes with program from [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)
- Written study notes and collected textual content on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)
- The code was edited with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the preview was provided via [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) VS Code extension.
- The code versions were managed with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- The code and project deliverables are stored on cloud service [Github](https://github.com/) repository with versions.
- The website is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- The development machine runs [Windows 7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7) operating system.
- The website was tested on desktop on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) web browsers, also on a [OnePlus2](https://www.oneplus.com/ie/support/spec/oneplus-2) mobile phone running [Android](https://www.android.com/) and mobile [Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en) browser.
- Generated favicons with [Favicon & App Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- Generated one image (on top of this Readme) of how the website looks on different size devices with [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
- Played with colors on [coolors](https://coolors.co/), chose the base colors with it
- Chose font using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- run CSS code through [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to supplement suggested vendor prefixes
- Searched the internet to find content, documentation and solution for issues using [Google](www.google.com)'s search service.
- connected to the internet using [Vodafone](https://n.vodafone.ie/shop/broadband.html)'s broadband service.

## 4. Issues solved during development
### 4.1 Top-Fixed navbar and anchors
At late stage added the top-fixed navbar to all pages. Before it was only on **Home**. After the change realised, that when jumping from Home to About to a specific section, e.g. `who`, the title of that section is not visible, because the target section get scrolled to the top of the page and the navbar obscures the top of the section.
Found solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19532678/anchored-bookmarks-conflicting-with-fixed-top-of-page-nav).

For each section created its own achor tag, e.g. for `who`:
```HTML
<a class="nav-anchor-negative" id="who"></a>
```
and the class definition in `style.css`:
```CSS
.nav-anchor-negative {
    position:relative; 
    top: -4rem;    
}
```
The solution creates a relative positioned anchor tag above its normal place, so the jump target becomes above the real target, so the target section gets positioned right below the navbar.
### 4.2 Trouble with opacity layer on hero image
**Home** page / Hero image / Call To Action button did not work, although I implemented the same way as we did in the "Whiskey Drop" project. After some debugging I concluded that the opacity layer is in the way, which prevents the clicking. When I commented out this layer, the button worked.
Tried to play with CSS z-index, but was not satisfied with the lot of changes it required just to set up the necessary order of objects, only to make it work.

Found solution [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-change-a-css-background-images-opacity) / Method 2. In essence, I threw out the `<div>&nbsp;<div>` from HTML and put the opacity layer functionality into `.hero:before` in `style.css`, where `.hero` holds the content displayed above the hero image.

code in `index.html`:
```HTML
<!-- HEADER - HERO section -->
  <header class="hero ...">
  ...
</header>
```
code in `style.css`:
```CSS
.hero {
    position: relative;
    ...
}
.hero:before {
    content: ' ';
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    background: url(...) center center / cover no-repeat;
    background-color: ...;
    opacity: 0.4;
    z-index: -1;
}
```
### 4.3 Style list item decorators
When created  `constitution.html` page, where I have a long document with numbered sections, I wanted to style each list item's first paragraph as a heading (e.g.```<h2>```. When I did that, the number in front of the paragraph was not styled the same way. See **expected** result here:

![style decimal](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-li-decimal-styling-goal.png)

I could not find simple solution on the internet, so I solved this way:
```HTML
<ol class="... list-with-header">
   <li>
      <p>Name and Affiliation of Club</p>
      <p>The name of the Club shall be ...</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Club Mission</p>
      <p>To promote Kettlebell sport by creating a ...</p>
   </li>
  ...
</ol>
```
and styling in `style.css`:
```CSS
/* style the numbers of the <li>s of <ol> */
.list-with-header > li {
    font-size: 1.5rem;    
}
/* then dial back for the child elements (except for the first one) */
.list-with-header > li > *:not(:first-child) {
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```
Solution: I figured, that to style the numbers, I need to style the whole `<ol>` and then restore the normal style (`font-height`) for every child element, except the first one.

### 4.4 Content hinting on mobile device
Issue: I wanted content hinting on the landing page, by revealing at the bottom of the screen, that the page continues further below the hero image. To achive that, I used `height: 89vh` on the container of the hero image. To my surprise, the `89vh` was not enough on mobile devices, although it looked ok during preview on simulated mobile device screen sizes. Se expected on the left, reality on the right.
![content hinting](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-content-hinting.png)

The problem is that the browser on a mobile device determines the VH unit in a different way from the browser on a desktop. See issue and solution [here](https://css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile/)

Applied solution: created variable `--vh89` on **Home** page to determine the `89%` of "real" `VH` (Vieport Height) for mobile device browsers:
```HTML
<script>
  function setRealVieportHeightVariable(){
    let vh89 = window.innerHeight * 0.89;
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--vh89', `${vh89}px`);
  };
  setRealVieportHeightVariable();
  window.addEventListener('resize', setRealVieportHeightVariable);
</script>
```
The event listener is there for capturing the orientation change between portrait and landscape. 

And used the variable `--vh89` in the `style.css`:
```CSS
.hero {
    height: 89vh;
    height: var(--vh89);
    min-height: 27rem;
    ...
}
```

## 5. Testing

First step in testing was the validation of HTML and CSS code with [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) respectively. I did the validations a couple of times during development and once at the end. Now all 6 html pages validate to "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.". The `style.css` file validates to "Congratulations! No Error Found."

The whole testing were conducted manually.

Here is a sample from the test log, see the complete document [here](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-testing.pdf)

```
Background: 
Desktop device is a desktop Windows 7 operating system running Chrome (on 1920x1080 pixels screen) and Firefox browser (on 1600x1200 pixels screen)
Mobile device is a OnePlus2 mobile phone running OxigenOS 3.6.1 (eq. Android 6.0.1) and Chrome Mobile browser on screen resolution 1080x1920 pixels

User Story:
As a website visitor with intent on joining my first training with the club, I want to announce my arrival, so they know my name, my background and they will expect me.

Scenario: visitor is interested in joining a training session
And may provide a valid email address OR may not
And provides a personal message
Given visitor is on the TryOut page
When scrolls to the HeadsUp section to the form with 3 fields and Send button
And enters something into “Your name” field
And enters a valid email address into “Your email” field OR leaves it empty
And enters something into “Tell us about yourself” field
And clicks on the Send button
Then the form is sent
And new page opens in a separate browser tab with a table of two columns of sent data: (“Input Name”, “Value”)
And there is a table row with values (applicantname, <entered value of “Your name” field>)
And there is a table row with values (applicantemail, <entered value of “Your email” field> OR empty)
And there is a table row with values (applicantstory, <entered value of “Tell us about yourself” field>)
```
|Test no.|Pre-condition|Event|Expected|Result|Comment|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|on Desktop Chrome, TryOut page is open|- Scroll to the section "Heads Up!"<br>- Enter "Visitor" into form field “Your name”,<br>- Enter "visitor@gmail.com" into field "Your email"<br>- Enter "hello" into field “Tell us about yourself”<br>- Click on button "Send"|new page opens in a separate browser tab with a table of<br>(Input Name, Value)<br>(applicantname, Visitor)<br>(applicantemail, visitor@gmail.com)<br>(applicantstory, hello)|pass|-|

The website performs on desktop and mobile devices as intended, no responsivity issues were found.

No additional bugs were discovered during the final testing.

## 6. Deployment

The website is deployed to GitHub Pages automatically by GitHub. The assigned web address is [ruszkipista.github.io/cims01-lkc/](https://ruszkipista.github.io/cims01-lkc/).
I followed [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) tutorial to deploy the project on GitHub Pages, these were the steps:
1. On GitHub navigate to the repository's main page
2. Under your repository name, click Settings
![Repository/Settings](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-deployment-1.png "Click on Settings")
3. Under "GitHub Pages", use the None or Branch drop-down menu and select a publishing source
![Settings/GitHub Pages/Branch](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-deployment-2.png "Click on Branch")
4. Optionally, use the drop-down menu to select a folder for your publishing source
![Settings/GitHub Pages/Source](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-deployment-3.png "Click on Root")
5. Click Save
![Settings/GitHub Pages/Save](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-deployment-4.png "Click on Save")
6. After a while you are presented whith this status message at the same place
![Settings/GitHub Pages](./assets/doc/ci-ms1-deployment-5.png "Your site is published")

If you want to deploy this project to a different hosting solution, you need to copy all the files from this repository. Follow the repository cloning steps from [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) tutorial.
After you have your local copies of these files, you copy them into the home folder of the webserver, keeping the folder structure as is.
Just because this is a static website, you can even start up the Home page by double clicking on the `index.html` file in your local file system - effectively launching you default browser with the starting page.
